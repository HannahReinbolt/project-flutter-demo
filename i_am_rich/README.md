# i_am_rich

A Flutter app based on Armin Heinrich's "I Am Rich" app that he released in the App store in 2008. The app was released for the maximum price of $999.99 under the category "Lifestyle" that was described as "a work of art with no hidden function at all". The purpose of this app was to show other people that they were able to afford it. This app was very simple and only displayed a text mantra and a picture of a ruby that people could show others. Eight people bought this before it was takin down. 
The current app developed here is created in a simalir way in order to learn basic Flutter app development architecture.
